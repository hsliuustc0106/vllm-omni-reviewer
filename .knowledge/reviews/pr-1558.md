# PR #1558: [Enhancement] Escalate stage timeout to error

Part of process lifecycle improvements (#1557/#1346). Escalates stage timeout to error. Critical issue: self.close() is no-op because _weak_finalizer not set up yet, causing resource leaks. Also updates pytests to expect TimeoutError. Needs finalizer setup fix before merge.
