# PR #1561: [Enhancement] Patch OmniStage.try_collect() with ray alive checks

Part of process lifecycle improvements (#1557/#1346). Adds Ray task alive checks. CRITICAL BUG: is_ray_task_alive() condition is inverted - will raise error for healthy workers! Also has duplicate kill_ray_actor calls. Must fix before merge.
